dynamo-fuse
===========

Linux FUSE file system implementation with AWS DynamoDB as the storage

Installation
============

Simply download the dynamofs.py or install it using `pip install dynamo-fuse`

Usage
=====

1. Install python-fuse:

        pip install python-fuse

2. Create an AWS Dynamo DB table in the region of your choice. The table must have Hash key named `path` and Range key named `name` (case matters, both Strings)

3. Define environment variables for AWS key - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. At the moment only the configuration by environment variables is supported.
The user with these keys must have read/write access to the specified AWS Dynamo DB table.

4. Execute python command to mount the filesystem:

        python -m dynamofuse.fs <aws region> <dynamo table> <mount point>

   This will mount the table to the mount point. After that you will be able to execute normal Linux file commands, such as "ls" or "mkdir".

Limitations
===========

**Note**: This project is in its early R&D stage. Various designs and implementation strategies are being tried for file system operations
so any mission-critical usage is not yet recommended. However, the implementation is already almost POSIX-compliant (only 19 out of all [fstest](http://www.tuxera.com/community/posix-test-suite/)
 are failing).

However, the behavior during concurrent access to the same files or directories is not well handled at the moment and may result in inconsistent results.
Also, locking is not supported yet.
